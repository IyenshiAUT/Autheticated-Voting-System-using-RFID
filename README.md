 𝑷𝒓𝒐𝒋𝒆𝒄𝒕 𝑶𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒗𝒊𝒆𝒘:
In today’s world, security and accuracy in voting processes are more important than ever. This project aims to address these concerns by leveraging RFID technology to ensure that each voter can cast their vote securely and only once.

🚀 𝑲𝒆𝒚 𝑭𝒆𝒂𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒆𝒔:
~ RFID Authentication:
The system uses RFID tags to authenticate voters. Only individuals with pre-registered RFID tags can access the voting process, ensuring that only authorized votes are counted.
~ Real-Time Validation:
To prevent multiple votes from the same person, the system validates each RFID tag against a pre-loaded list of authenticated tags. If the tag has already been used, the system alerts the user and blocks the vote.
~ User Feedback via LCD Display:
The system is equipped with an LCD display that guides the voter through the process. It displays the RFID tag details, voting options, and a confirmation message once the vote is cast.
~ Vote Counting and Result Display:
The system can handle votes for four different candidates. Once the voting session ends, it tallies the votes and displays the results on the LCD screen.
~ LED Indicators:
Visual feedback is provided through LEDs—lighting up when a valid vote is cast and turning off after the voting process is complete

🛠️ 𝑻𝒆𝒄𝒉𝒏𝒐𝒍𝒐𝒈𝒊𝒄𝒂𝒍 𝑯𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒍𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒕𝒔:
~ ATMega328p Microcontroller:
Powered by an ATmega microcontroller, programmed in C, with precise control over input/output operations.
Peripherals:
The system integrates several peripherals, including:
~ EM18 RFID Reader Module
~ UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)
~ LCD Display
~ Digital I/O Ports
~ Custom Embedded Libraries: Developed custom libraries for UART communication and LCD control, ensuring efficient and reliable operation.

📈 𝑳𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒏𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝑻𝒂𝒌𝒆𝒂𝒘𝒂𝒚𝒔:
This project was more than just about coding—it was about solving real-world problems using embedded systems. Here are a few key takeaways:
~ Hands-on Experience: Gained practical experience in hardware-software integration, crucial for real-time systems.
~ Security Considerations: Enhanced my understanding of securing embedded systems, particularly in applications where integrity is critical.
